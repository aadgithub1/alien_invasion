In the game alien invasion a player controls a ship
at the bottom center of the screen. A fleet of aliens
flies across and down the screen. The player can shoot
bullets from his/her ship to destroy the aliens. If
an alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom
of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player
loses three ships, the game ends.
